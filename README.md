# Project Survey
Main focus with this project was to learn how to break up elements into reusable components and to use the useState hook to update the state of the elements. 

As a stretch goal I focused on using many different form elements:
- Button
- Input
- Textarea
- Radio
- Checkbox
- Range slider
- Select dropdown

I also focused on creating a multi-step survey with focus on only one question at the time. If I had more time I would want to continue with my initial goal of having the code more dynamic and only use the JSON file to control the survey.
